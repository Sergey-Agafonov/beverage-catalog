# Beverage catalog app by Sergey Agafonov (stack used: Vue/Vite/Pinia/Cypress/Bootstrap)

You will need Node to run locally. The app also utilizes backend API server (Node/Express/SQLite) which cannot be made public at the moment, if you would like a preview, please open an issue, I'll try to accommodate your request.

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```
